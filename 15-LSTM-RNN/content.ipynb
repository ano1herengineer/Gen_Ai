    "### Introduction to LSTM RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to overcome the limitations of traditional RNNs, particularly in handling long-term dependencies. While RNNs are capable of processing sequential data by maintaining a hidden state that captures information from previous time steps, they struggle with the vanishing gradient problem. This issue arises during backpropagation, where gradients can become very small, causing the network to stop learning effectively over long sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTMs address this problem by incorporating a more sophisticated architecture that includes mechanisms to control the flow of information. These mechanisms, known as gates, allow LSTMs to retain and utilize information over extended periods, making them highly effective for tasks that require understanding long-term dependencies. By mitigating the vanishing gradient problem, LSTMs have become a popular choice for various applications, including natural language processing, time series forecasting, and speech recognition."

    "### 1. Problem with RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are designed to handle sequential data by maintaining a hidden state that captures information from previous time steps. However, RNNs struggle with long-term dependencies due to the vanishing gradient problem. During backpropagation, gradients can become very small, causing the network to stop learning effectively. This makes it difficult for RNNs to retain information over long sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Why LSTM RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks were introduced to address the limitations of standard RNNs. LSTMs are capable of learning long-term dependencies by using a more complex architecture that includes mechanisms to control the flow of information. This helps in mitigating the vanishing gradient problem, allowing the network to retain information over longer periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. How LSTM RNN Works\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTMs use a combination of long-term memory and short-term memory to manage information flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a) Long Term Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Long-term memory in LSTMs is maintained through a cell state that runs through the entire sequence. This cell state acts as a conveyor belt, allowing information to flow unchanged unless explicitly modified by gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b) Short Term Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Short-term memory is managed through hidden states that capture information from the current time step and are updated at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. LSTM Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTM networks consist of a series of cells, each containing three main gates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Forget Gate**: Decides what information to discard from the cell state.\n",
    "- **Input Gate**: Determines which new information to add to the cell state.\n",
    "- **Output Gate**: Controls what information to output based on the cell state and hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Working of LSTM RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Forget Gate**: The forget gate takes the previous hidden state and the current input to produce a value between 0 and 1 for each number in the cell state. A value of 0 means \"completely forget\" and a value of 1 means \"completely keep.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    f_t = sigmoid(W_f * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Input Gate**: The input gate decides which values to update. It consists of two parts: a sigmoid layer that decides which values to update and a tanh layer that creates a vector of new candidate values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    i_t = sigmoid(W_i * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)\n",
    "    \\tilde{C}_t = tanh(W_C * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Update Cell State**: The cell state is updated by combining the old cell state, scaled by the forget gate, and the new candidate values, scaled by the input gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    C_t = f_t * C_{t-1} + i_t * \\tilde{C}_t\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output Gate**: The output gate decides what the next hidden state should be. It is based on the updated cell state and the current input.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    o_t = sigmoid(W_o * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)\n",
    "    h_t = o_t * tanh(C_t)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "By using these gates, LSTMs can effectively manage long-term dependencies and mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, making them suitable for tasks that require learning from long sequences of data."

    "- **Hidden State (h_t)**: The short-term memory, which is also the output of the LSTM cell at each time step.\n",
    "\n",

Over time, several variants of LSTM networks have been proposed to improve their performance and adapt them to different tasks. Here are some notable LSTM variants:\n",
