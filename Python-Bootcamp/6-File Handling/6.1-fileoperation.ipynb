    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Opening a File**: Use the `open()` function with the file name and mode (`'r'` for read, `'w'` for write, `'a'` for append, `'b'` for binary).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reading a File**: Use methods like `read()`, `readline()`, or `readlines()` to read file content.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Writing to a File**: Use `write()` or `writelines()` to write data to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Closing a File**: Always close the file using `close()` to free up system resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Using `with` Statement**: Ensures the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Binary File Operations**: Use `'b'` mode to handle binary files, such as images or executable files.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Read and Write (`w+` Mode)**: Opens a file for both reading and writing. If the file does not exist, it creates a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "These operations are fundamental for handling files in Python, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval."
